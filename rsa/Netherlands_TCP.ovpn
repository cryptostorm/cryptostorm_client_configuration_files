# "Require that peer certificate was signed with an explicit key usage and extended key usage based on

# man-in-the-middle attack where an authorized client attempts to connect to another client by
# impersonating the server. The attack is easily prevented by having clients verify the server certificate
# using any one of --remote-cert-tls, --verify-x509-name, or --tls-verify."

# "Accept connections only if a host's X.509 name is equal to name.
# The remote host must also pass all other tests of verification."
# This covers the scenario where a server gets confiscated/hacked by 'whoever', and 'whoever' also has the
# ability to perform a man-in-the-middle attack against traffic coming into another server
# (or leaving a client). They could use the stolen server certificate/key to impersonate that other server,

# "Call --down cmd/script before, rather than after, TUN/TAP close."
# No down cmd/script is used in this configuration, but most Linux users will be adding an up/down script
# that updates the system's DNS. Without this the system would have to wait for the tunnel to close before
# it could update the DNS, which might lead to DNS resolution failures until TUN closes.

# Uncomment the below line to enable --auth-nocache
#auth-nocache
# "this directive will cause OpenVPN to immediately forget username/password inputs after they are used".
# We're not enabling it because, for users that are inputting their token using standard input,
# it can be annoying since OpenVPN will constantly ask them for their token on every TLS renegotiation.
# For those providing a file to --auth-user-pass, --auth-nocache has no effect.

# "If an AEAD cipher mode (e.g. GCM) is chosen, the specified --auth algorithm is ignored for the data channel, 
# and the authentication method of the AEAD cipher is used instead."
# The default legacy cipher for these RSA configs is AES-256-CBC, with negotiable support for AES-256-GCM (see below)
auth SHA512

# This is the cipher that will encrypt OpenVPN's "data channel", i.e. your actual traffic.
cipher AES-256-CBC
# AES-256 = "256 bit key, 128 bit block". We recommend GCM over CBC mostly because it's more efficient.
# Here's a speed test of CBC vs GCM on a random Linux system:
#  echo $(($(openssl speed -mr -evp aes-256-cbc -bytes 128 2>&1|tail -n1|awk -F: '{print int($NF)}')/1024/1024))MBps
#  431MBps
#  echo $(($(openssl speed -mr -evp aes-256-gcm -bytes 128 2>&1|tail -n1|awk -F: '{print int($NF)}')/1024/1024))MBps
#  815MBps
# That means GCM encrypts data almost twice as fast as CBC, so long as your CPU supports the AES-NI instruction.
# If your CPU doesn't support AES-NI, CBC would perform better:
#  export OPENSSL_ia32cap="~0x200000200000000" # This temporarily disables AES-NI
#  echo $(($(openssl speed -mr -evp aes-256-cbc -bytes 128 2>&1|tail -n1|awk -F: '{print int($NF)}')/1024/1024))MBps
#  218MBps
#  echo $(($(openssl speed -mr -evp aes-256-gcm -bytes 128 2>&1|tail -n1|awk -F: '{print int($NF)}')/1024/1024))MBps
#  133MBps
# Only clients using very old versions of OpenVPN will get AES-256-CBC, for everyone else the server will use 
# --data-ciphers (formerly called --ncp-ciphers) to negotiate the cipher to AES-256-GCM.
# If you really want to use CBC, and you have OpenVPN 2.5, you can use --data-ciphers AES-256-CBC to force CBC mode.
# But if you're using OpenVPN 2.5, then you should just use the ECC configs and --cipher CHACHA20-POLY1305 instead.
# If you've got anything before 2.5, you can use --ncp-ciphers AES-256-CBC to force CBC mode.
# The padding oracle attack against CBC described @ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padding_oracle_attack doesn't apply 
# in this context since OpenVPN will use an HMAC, and OpenVPN's CBC does encrypt-then-mac, not mac-then-encrypt.

# Minimum TLS version allowed is 1.2 to prevent downgrade attacks.
tls-version-min 1.2

# The below tls-cipher defines the encryption algorithm used to encrypt the control channel:
#  "OpenVPN uses TLS to secure the control channel, over which the keys that
#  are used to protect the actual VPN traffic are exchanged."
# Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman + Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm with ChaCha20-Poly1305 + SHA256,
# which is what we recommend, but if it's unavailable, then instead
# Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman + Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm with AES-256-GCM + SHA384 is used,
# and if that's unavailable then
# Diffie-Hellman + RSA with AES-256-CBC-SHA is used, and perfect forward secrecy is provided using 8192-bit DH params server-side.
# The CA certificate uses secp521r1 and the server certificate uses 8192-bit RSA.
tls-cipher TLS-ECDHE-RSA-WITH-CHACHA20-POLY1305-SHA256:TLS-ECDHE-RSA-WITH-AES-256-GCM-SHA384:TLS-DHE-RSA-WITH-AES-256-CBC-SHA

# "Enable TLS and assume client role during TLS handshake."
tls-client

# The CA certificate, which uses secp521r1 for the key and ecdsa-with-SHA512 for the signature algorithm.
# secp521r1 is a 521-bit elliptic curve, roughly equivalent to 15360-bit RSA, however some people choose
# not to use it because it's an NIST curve - https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.186-4.pdf
# There was an incident involving the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG algorithm where a backdoor
# was deliberately inserted by the NSA, and even though weaknesses in the algorithm's cryptographic security
# were publicly known, it was still included in https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-90Ar1.pdf
# Some cryptographers believe that if the NIST allowed something like that once, they'll probably do it again.
# There are no publicly known cryptographic weaknesses in secp521r1, but if you're still concerned about potential
# backdoors in secp521r1, you should use our ed25519 or ed448 configs (or WireGuard).
# The only reason we're not using ed25519/ed448 by default is because a lot of our customers are still using older
# versions of OpenVPN/OpenSSL that don't yet support ed25519/ed448.
# This part of the config is what prevents man-in-the-middle attacks from succeeding. If an attacker redirected you
# to their own malicious server, OpenVPN would spit out an error because that server wouldn't be able to generate a
# valid server certificate/key pair because they wouldn't have the CA's private key.
# We practice secure PKI management as described in https://community.openvpn.net/openvpn/wiki/Hardening
# which means that the CA private key is never stored on any of our VPN servers.
